- Average duration: 2.7 min
- Total execution time: 0.31 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 1 - Foundation & Validation | 2/2 | 5.4 min | 2.7 min |
| 2 - Input & Proxy | 1/2 | 4.0 min | 4.0 min |
| 5 - Repository Restructuring | 1/1 | 3.0 min | 3.0 min |

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

See PROJECT.md Key Decisions table for full list.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

| Decision | Phase | Impact |
|----------|-------|--------|
| Include root ('.') in pnpm-workspace.yaml | 05-01 | Cloudflare Pages compatibility |
| Use relative path for tsconfig extends | 05-01 | TypeScript package resolution |
| Explicit noUncheckedIndexedAccess + exactOptionalPropertyTypes | 05-01 | Maximum type safety (not in strict: true) |
| Named exports only (no default) | 05-01 | IIFE/UMD browser compatibility |
| Zero runtime deps: Vendor Base58 + keccak256 | Roadmap | Minimal bundle size |
| Use tsdown (not tsup) | Roadmap | Better UMD support, actively maintained |
| 27 error codes with satisfies Record<> enforcement | 06-01 | Type-safe message mapping |
| prop?: T \| undefined for optional fields | 06-01 | exactOptionalPropertyTypes compliance |
| Store EVM addresses in lowercase for case-insensitive lookup | 06-03 | Asset registry implementation |
| Separate isValidCaip2 from isKnownNetwork | 06-03 | Unknown-but-valid networks produce warnings not errors |
| Use community convention for Aptos networks (aptos:1, aptos:2) | 06-03 | No official CAIP namespace yet |
| Detection uses x402Version value, not resource presence | 06-02 | v2 without resource detects as v2, fails validation later |
| Payments array alone identifies flat-legacy format | 06-02 | Handles nested network/chain in payments entries |
| Preserve unrecognized networks through normalization | 06-02 | Validation catches unknown networks with actionable errors |

### Pending Todos

None.

### Blockers/Concerns

- tsdown UMD config specifics need verification during Phase 9
- Keccak-256 vendoring strategy (vendor vs devDep+tree-shake) to decide in Phase 7
