# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-04)

**Core value:** Developers can validate their x402 config in under 30 seconds with actionable feedback
**Current focus:** Milestone v3.0 -- Manifest Validation & CLI

## Current Position

Phase: 14 - CLI Manifest Mode (complete)
Plan: 03 of 03 complete
Status: Phase 14 complete
Progress: [█████.....] 5/6 v3.0 phases
Last activity: 2026-02-05 -- Completed 14-03-PLAN.md (CLI manifest test coverage)

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 23 (3 v1.0 + 12 v2.0 + 8 v3.0)
- Average duration: 3.1 min
- Total execution time: 1.13 hours

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

See PROJECT.md Key Decisions table for full list.

**v3.0 roadmap decisions:**
- 6 phases derived from 9 requirements and research recommendations
- Stacks (Phase 12) runs parallel with Manifest Validation (Phase 13)
- CLI (Phase 14) runs parallel with Website (Phase 15)
- Critical path: 11 -> 13 -> 14 -> 16
- Bazaar deep JSON Schema validation deferred (structural validation only in v3.0)
- Bundle size target: 45 KB minified (conservative, accommodates Stacks c32check overhead)

**Phase 11-01 decisions:**
- Manifest detection must occur before v2 (manifests may have x402Version: 2)
- Empty endpoints ({}) is valid to allow manifest initialization
- Type guards (isManifestConfig, isV2Config, isV1Config) exported from main entry for SDK users
- Manifest error codes marked as unreachable until Phase 13 validation implemented

**Phase 11-02 decisions:**
- Wild manifest normalization returns warnings (not errors) for migration path
- URL-path-based endpoint IDs preferred over index-based for stability
- Two-pattern detection (array-style + nested-service-style) covers 95% of wild manifests
- Financial data (amounts, addresses, networks) never modified during normalization
- Collision handling with -2, -3 suffix ensures no endpoint ID data loss

**Phase 12-01 decisions:**
- c32check standalone package chosen over @stacks/transactions for minimal bundle overhead
- Network-aware version byte validation required (SP/SM only valid on stacks:1, ST/SN only on stacks:2147483648)
- Contract name suffixes stripped before validation (e.g., SP123.token → SP123)
- Single INVALID_STACKS_ADDRESS code for format/checksum errors, separate STACKS_NETWORK_MISMATCH for network mismatches
- Bundle size 58.19 KB (over 45KB target) accepted given 19.86 KB gzipped and comprehensive validation depth

**Phase 13-01 decisions:**
- Use Record instead of Map for endpointResults to enable direct JSON serialization
- Include normalized manifest in result for caller convenience
- All cross-endpoint checks return warnings not errors per CONTEXT.md user decisions
- Bazaar method discrimination returns errors not warnings per CONTEXT.md user decisions
- Structural validation only for bazaar schemas to avoid Ajv dependency and bundle bloat
- Bracket notation for field paths to handle endpoint IDs with special characters
- Empty endpoints ({}) returns valid:true per Phase 11 decision

**Phase 13-02 decisions:**
- Use valid checksummed EVM addresses in test helpers to ensure per-endpoint validation passes cleanly
- Group tests by validation layer (basic, per-endpoint, cross-endpoint, bazaar, edge cases) for clarity

**Phase 14-01 decisions:**
- cli-table3 as devDependency (tsdown bundles it, not exposed to library users)
- node:util parseArgs API for modern argument parsing with repeatable flags
- Manual redirect tracking with configurable limits for better control and error handling
- Manifest auto-detection in resolveInput() with wild manifest normalization support

**Phase 14-02 decisions:**
- Apply strict mode post-validation for manifests (validateManifest doesn't accept options)
- Manifest exit code based on majority pass/fail (not single endpoint failure)
- Detection announcements printed before results for user clarity
- cli-table3 bundled with CLI binary (216 KB bundle, acceptable for standalone)

**Phase 14-03 decisions:**
- --quiet flag takes precedence over --json in all formatters (bug fix)
- Inline JSON manifest creation for majority-fail tests avoids fixture proliferation
- Test fixtures use real checksummed addresses to ensure per-endpoint validation passes

### Pending Todos

None.

### Blockers/Concerns

**Bundle size trend:** IIFE bundle grew from ~31KB (pre-Stacks) to 58.19 KB (post-Stacks) to 62.59 KB (post-manifest validation). CLI bundle is 216 KB (bundled with cli-table3). Gzipped sizes remain good (21.14 KB IIFE, 57.68 KB CLI). Growth is acceptable given comprehensive manifest validation capability and standalone CLI with no runtime dependencies.

## Session Continuity

Last session: 2026-02-05 03:09 UTC
Stopped at: Completed Phase 14-03 (CLI Manifest Test Coverage)
Resume file: None
Next: Phase 15 (Website Integration) or Phase 16 (Final v3.0 Release). Critical path continues through 16.
