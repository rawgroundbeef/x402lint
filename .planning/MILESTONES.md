# Project Milestones: x402lint

## v2.0 Spec-Compliant SDK (Shipped: 2026-02-04)

**Delivered:** Standalone TypeScript npm package (`x402lint`) that correctly validates x402 v1/v2 payment configs with 30 error codes, vendored crypto, and zero runtime dependencies — plus website rebuilt on SDK's 27KB browser bundle.

**Phases completed:** 5-10 (12 plans total)

**Key accomplishments:**

- Standalone `x402lint` npm package with validate(), detect(), normalize() pure-function APIs
- Spec-correct validation with 30 error codes, CAIP-2 network validation, and actionable fix suggestions
- Vendored keccak-256 and Base58 with canary tests proving correctness against reference vectors
- Multi-format build (ESM + CJS + IIFE) at 27KB minified / 9KB gzipped, publint validated
- Website rebuilt on SDK — replaced ~810KB of CDN scripts with single 27KB IIFE bundle
- 217 test cases covering every validation rule, format detection, normalization, and address validation

**Stats:**

- 172 files created/modified
- 2,502 lines SDK TypeScript, 11,937 total project lines
- 6 phases, 12 plans, ~26 tasks
- 3 days from start to ship (2026-01-29 → 2026-01-31)

**Git range:** `925f344` (docs(05): capture phase context) → `a4bd2d2` (feat: add x402lint npm package)

**What's next:** npm publishing, CI/CD pipeline, extended chain support (Stellar, Aptos, Bitcoin address validation).

## v1.0 MVP (Shipped: 2026-01-29)

**Delivered:** Working x402 payment config validator with URL/JSON input, CORS proxy, results display with verdict-first layout, FAQ, and example configs.

**Phases completed:** 1-4 (3 plans executed via GSD, remaining work done manually)

**Key accomplishments:**

- Core validation engine with EVM checksum (EIP-55) and Solana Base58 address validation
- Cloudflare Worker CORS proxy with SSRF protection, deployed to production
- Full UI with smart URL/JSON input detection, method selector, example configs
- Results display with verdict-first hierarchy, inline status badges, collapsible response body
- FAQ section, footer with credits, mobile-responsive layout

**Stats:**

- 28 files created/modified
- 3,078 lines of HTML/JS
- 2 phases (4 plans tracked), plus significant manual work beyond roadmap
- 7 days from start to ship (2026-01-22 → 2026-01-29)

**Git range:** `d29b3bc` (docs: initialize project) → `8796a7c` (style: add more spacing between footer links)

**What's next:** Spec-compliant SDK rewrite — align validator with canonical x402 v2 spec (CAIP-2 networks, `accepts` array, `payTo`, `amount`, `scheme`, `resource`), extract as standalone npm package with comprehensive tests, then rebuild website on top.
