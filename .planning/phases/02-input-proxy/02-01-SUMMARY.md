# Phase 02 Plan 01: CORS Proxy Summary

**Cloudflare Worker CORS proxy deployed, enabling URL validation by proxying requests with proper CORS headers and x402 header exposure**

## Performance

- **Duration:** 4 min
- **Started:** 2026-01-28T22:00:00Z
- **Completed:** 2026-01-28T22:04:00Z
- **Tasks:** 2
- **Files modified:** 2

## Accomplishments
- Cloudflare Worker with CORS preflight handling (OPTIONS returns 204)
- Origin validation against allowlist for security
- SSRF protection blocking internal IP ranges
- x402 header exposure (PAYMENT-REQUIRED, X-Payment) in CORS
- Worker deployed to Cloudflare Workers

## Task Commits

Each task was committed atomically:

1. **Task 1: Create Cloudflare Worker proxy with CORS handling** - `b9ccff2` (feat)
2. **Task 2: Deploy Worker and record URL** - `ef2f479` (fix - moved wrangler.toml to correct location)

## Files Created/Modified
- `worker/proxy.js` - 131-line Cloudflare Worker with CORS proxy logic
- `worker/wrangler.toml` - Worker configuration (moved from root during deployment)

## Deployed URL

**https://x402-proxy.mail-753.workers.dev**

This URL is needed for Plan 02-02 to configure fetch requests.

## Decisions Made

**Security measures:**
- Origin allowlist restricts which sites can use the proxy
- SSRF protection blocks requests to internal IP ranges (169.254.x.x, 10.x.x.x, etc.)
- User-Agent header identifies requests as coming from x402lint

**CORS configuration:**
- Access-Control-Allow-Origin reflects request Origin (not wildcard)
- Access-Control-Expose-Headers includes PAYMENT-REQUIRED and X-Payment for x402 config extraction
- Access-Control-Max-Age: 86400 (24h preflight cache)

## Deviations from Plan

**wrangler.toml location:**
- Plan had wrangler.toml in project root with comment "cd worker && npx wrangler deploy"
- Wrangler expects wrangler.toml in the directory where it runs
- Fixed by moving wrangler.toml to worker/ directory

## Issues Encountered

None - deployment succeeded after correcting wrangler.toml location.

## User Setup Required

None - worker is deployed and accessible. No API keys or environment variables needed.

## Next Phase Readiness

**Ready for Plan 02-02 (Smart Input UI):**
- Proxy URL available: https://x402-proxy.mail-753.workers.dev
- Proxy handles CORS preflight requests
- Proxy exposes x402 headers to client JavaScript
- Proxy validates origin and blocks SSRF
