    provides: Type definitions and error vocabulary
provides:
  - Network registry with 11 chains (Base, Avalanche, Solana, Stellar, Aptos)

  - Asset registry with USDC addresses per network
  - Simple name to CAIP-2 mapping for legacy fix suggestions
  - Case-insensitive EVM address lookup

# Phase 6 Plan 03: Network and Asset Registries Summary

**CAIP-2 network registry with 11 chains, asset registry with USDC addresses, and simple name mapping for legacy format fix suggestions**

## Performance

- **Duration:** 2.8 min (167 seconds)
- **Started:** 2026-01-29T16:09:08Z
- **Completed:** 2026-01-29T16:11:55Z
- **Tasks:** 2
- **Files created:** 5
- **Files modified:** 1

## Accomplishments

- Network registry with Base, Base Sepolia, Avalanche, Avalanche Fuji, Solana (mainnet + devnet + testnet), Stellar (mainnet + testnet), and Aptos (mainnet + testnet)
- CAIP-2 format validation (CAIP2_REGEX) separate from registry lookup to enable unknown-but-valid warning path
- Asset registry with USDC addresses for Base, Base Sepolia, Avalanche, and Solana mainnet
- Simple name mapping (base → eip155:8453) for legacy format fix suggestions
- Case-insensitive EVM address lookup via lowercase normalization
- Comprehensive test suite covering all registry operations (21 tests passing)

## Task Commits

Each task was committed atomically:

1. **Task 1: Network registry and CAIP-2 validation** - `92b64e8` (feat)
2. **Task 2: Asset registry, barrel exports, and tests** - `c93b933` (feat)

## Files Created/Modified

**Created:**
- `packages/x402lint/src/registries/networks.ts` - KNOWN_NETWORKS registry, CAIP-2 validation, NetworkInfo type
- `packages/x402lint/src/registries/assets.ts` - KNOWN_ASSETS registry, AssetInfo type, case-insensitive lookup
- `packages/x402lint/src/registries/simple-names.ts` - SIMPLE_NAME_TO_CAIP2 mapping for legacy chain names
- `packages/x402lint/src/registries/index.ts` - Barrel export for all registry modules
- `packages/x402lint/test/registries.test.ts` - Comprehensive tests for all registry operations

**Modified:**
- `packages/x402lint/src/index.ts` - Added `export * from './registries'`

## Decisions Made

**1. Store EVM addresses in lowercase for case-insensitive lookup**
- Rationale: EVM addresses are case-insensitive but often written in checksum format. Storing lowercase enables simple comparison without checksum validation overhead.
- Implementation: getAssetInfo and isKnownAsset call address.toLowerCase() when network namespace is 'eip155'

**2. Use community convention for Aptos networks**
- Network IDs: `aptos:1` (mainnet), `aptos:2` (testnet)
- Rationale: No official CAIP namespace for Aptos yet. Using community convention allows Aptos support while maintaining CAIP-2 format consistency.
- Risk: May need migration if official namespace is established

**3. Separate isValidCaip2 from isKnownNetwork**
- Rationale: Unknown-but-valid CAIP-2 networks should produce warnings (not errors). This separation enables downstream code to distinguish format errors from registry misses.
- Example: `eip155:999999` is valid format but unknown network → warning + fix suggestion

## Deviations from Plan

None - plan executed exactly as written.

## Issues Encountered

None - all tasks completed without unexpected problems.

## User Setup Required

None - no external service configuration required.

## Next Phase Readiness

**Ready for 06-02 (Detection and Normalization):**
- getCanonicalNetwork enables flat-legacy → v2 normalization (base → eip155:8453)
- isValidCaip2 enables format validation before registry lookup
- isKnownNetwork enables unknown network warnings with fix suggestions
- getNetworkNamespace enables network-type-specific validation logic

**Registry coverage:**
- EVM: Base + Avalanche (mainnet + testnet for each)
- Solana: All three networks (mainnet, devnet, testnet)
- Stellar: Mainnet + testnet
- Aptos: Mainnet + testnet

**Extensibility verified:**
- Adding a new chain requires one entry in KNOWN_NETWORKS
- Adding a new asset requires one entry in KNOWN_ASSETS[network]
- No logic changes needed for new registry entries
