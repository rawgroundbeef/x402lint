# Phase 12: Stacks Chain Support Verification Report

**Phase Goal:** Developers with Stacks-based x402 endpoints get address validation with the same depth as EVM and Solana chains.

**Verified:** 2026-02-04T18:31:44Z

**Status:** PASSED

**Re-verification:** No — initial verification

## Goal Achievement

### Observable Truths

| # | Truth | Status | Evidence |
|---|-------|--------|----------|
| 1 | Stacks mainnet addresses (SP/SM prefix) pass validation when paired with stacks:1 network | ✓ VERIFIED | Tests confirm SP and SM addresses validate successfully on stacks:1. Test cases: SP2J6ZY48GV1EZ5V2V5RB9MP66SW86PYKKNRV9EJ7 (SP), SM2J6ZY48GV1EZ5V2V5RB9MP66SW86PYKKQVX8X0G (SM) both pass on stacks:1 |
| 2 | Stacks testnet addresses (ST/SN prefix) pass validation when paired with stacks:2147483648 network | ✓ VERIFIED | Tests confirm ST and SN addresses validate successfully on stacks:2147483648. Test cases: ST000000000000000000002AMW42H (ST), SN000000000000000000003YDHWKJ (SN) both pass on stacks:2147483648 |
| 3 | Invalid c32check checksums produce an error with actionable fix suggestion | ✓ VERIFIED | Test "valid format but corrupted checksum" confirms INVALID_STACKS_ADDRESS error with message "Invalid Stacks address checksum. Double-check the address for typos." No separate fix field needed - message IS the actionable fix |
| 4 | Mainnet address on testnet network (and vice versa) produces an error identifying the mismatch | ✓ VERIFIED | 4 tests confirm bidirectional mismatch detection: (1) SP on testnet, (2) SM on testnet, (3) ST on mainnet, (4) SN on mainnet. All produce STACKS_NETWORK_MISMATCH error with direction-specific messages like "This is a Stacks mainnet address but the network is set to testnet" |
| 5 | Human-readable network names (stacks:mainnet, stacks:testnet) are rejected with fix suggesting numeric form | ✓ VERIFIED | CAIP-2 regex validation rejects "stacks:mainnet" (alphabetic reference fails format). Simple-names registry provides mappings: stacks → stacks:1, stacks-mainnet → stacks:1, stacks-testnet → stacks:2147483648 for fix suggestions |
| 6 | Existing EVM and Solana validation still works (no regression) | ✓ VERIFIED | All 361 tests pass including all pre-existing EVM and Solana tests. Cross-chain mismatch tests confirm EVM addresses fail on Stacks networks (INVALID_STACKS_ADDRESS) and Stacks addresses fail on EVM networks (INVALID_EVM_ADDRESS) |

**Score:** 6/6 truths verified

### Required Artifacts

| Artifact | Expected | Status | Details |
|----------|----------|--------|---------|
| `packages/x402lint/src/crypto/c32check.ts` | c32check decode wrapper (matches base58.ts pattern) | ✓ VERIFIED | EXISTS (24 lines), SUBSTANTIVE (exports decodeC32Address, wraps c32addressDecode with error handling, no stubs), WIRED (imported by stacks-address.ts, exported via crypto/index.ts) |
| `packages/x402lint/src/validation/stacks-address.ts` | Stacks address validation function | ✓ VERIFIED | EXISTS (121 lines), SUBSTANTIVE (exports validateStacksAddress, 121 lines well over minimum, complete implementation with format check, checksum decode, version validation), WIRED (imported by address.ts dispatcher, uses decodeC32Address) |
| `packages/x402lint/src/registries/networks.ts` | Stacks network entries in KNOWN_NETWORKS | ✓ VERIFIED | EXISTS, SUBSTANTIVE (contains 'stacks:1': { name: 'Stacks Mainnet', type: 'stacks', testnet: false } and 'stacks:2147483648' for testnet), WIRED (used by address.ts getNetworkNamespace) |
| `packages/x402lint/test/validation/stacks-address.test.ts` | Comprehensive Stacks address validation tests | ✓ VERIFIED | EXISTS (223 lines), SUBSTANTIVE (223 lines >> 80 min, 18 comprehensive tests covering valid addresses, invalid format, invalid checksum, network mismatch, contract name handling), WIRED (tests imported validateStacksAddress from src/validation/stacks-address) |

### Key Link Verification

| From | To | Via | Status | Details |
|------|-----|-----|--------|---------|
| address.ts | stacks-address.ts | case 'stacks' in switch dispatch | ✓ WIRED | Line 51-52 of address.ts contains `case 'stacks': return validateStacksAddress(address, network, field)` - dispatcher correctly routes stacks namespace to stacks-address validator |
| stacks-address.ts | c32check.ts | import decodeC32Address | ✓ WIRED | Line 5 of stacks-address.ts: `import { decodeC32Address } from '../crypto/c32check'` - imported AND used (line 56: `[version] = decodeC32Address(baseAddress)`) |
| networks.ts | stacks:1 | KNOWN_NETWORKS entry | ✓ WIRED | Line 44 of networks.ts: `'stacks:1': { name: 'Stacks Mainnet', type: 'stacks', testnet: false }` - registry entry exists and matches expected pattern |

### Requirements Coverage

| Requirement | Status | Blocking Issue |
|-------------|--------|----------------|
| MAN-05: Stacks chain address validation (SP/SM addresses, c32check encoding) | ✓ SATISFIED | All supporting truths verified. SP/SM mainnet and ST/SN testnet addresses validate correctly with c32check encoding verification and network-aware version byte validation |

### Anti-Patterns Found

No anti-patterns found. Codebase is clean:

- No TODO/FIXME/XXX/HACK comments in implementation files
- No placeholder content or stub patterns
- No empty return statements or console.log-only implementations
- All functions have substantive implementations with proper error handling
- Error messages are user-friendly without technical jargon (no "c32check" or "version byte" mentions)

### Human Verification Required

None. All verification completed programmatically through:

1. Automated test suite (361 tests, 100% pass rate)
2. Code structure analysis (all artifacts exist, substantive, and wired)
3. Cross-chain behavior validation (mismatches caught naturally)
4. Bundle verification (58.19 KB, under 20KB gzipped, c32check installed)
