# Phase 11: Manifest Types & Detection Verification Report

**Phase Goal:** Developers can detect whether input is a manifest (multi-endpoint collection) vs a single x402 config, and non-standard wild manifests are recognized and normalized.

**Verified:** 2026-02-04T17:48:46Z
**Status:** PASSED
**Re-verification:** No — initial verification

## Goal Achievement

### Observable Truths

| # | Truth | Status | Evidence |
|---|-------|--------|----------|
| 1 | detect() returns 'manifest' for valid manifest JSON with endpoints collection | ✓ VERIFIED | detect.ts line 27 checks isManifestConfig first; test manifest.test.ts line 150-157 confirms; all 339 tests pass |
| 2 | detect() continues to return 'v2', 'v1', and 'unknown' for single configs (no regressions) | ✓ VERIFIED | detect.ts lines 28-29 check v2/v1 after manifest; detection.test.ts regression tests verify v2/v1/unknown unchanged; all 339 tests pass |
| 3 | isManifestConfig() type guard correctly identifies manifests and rejects non-manifests | ✓ VERIFIED | guards.ts lines 47-62 implements guard with structural checks; manifest.test.ts lines 25-147 test 14 scenarios including true/false cases; all pass |
| 4 | ManifestConfig type defines canonical shape with service metadata and endpoints Record | ✓ VERIFIED | manifest.ts lines 32-37 defines ManifestConfig with endpoints: Record<string, V2Config> and optional service; imports V2Config from config.ts line 5 |
| 5 | TypeScript compiles without errors after ConfigFormat extension to include 'manifest' | ✓ VERIFIED | `pnpm --filter x402lint exec tsc --noEmit` passes with zero errors; config.ts line 8 defines ConfigFormat = 'manifest' | 'v2' | 'v1' | 'unknown' |
| 6 | Non-standard array-style manifests are detected and normalized to canonical ManifestConfig | ✓ VERIFIED | wild-manifest.ts lines 96-118 detects 4 array field names and normalizes; manifest.test.ts lines 224-331 test paymentEndpoints, payments, configs; all pass |
| 7 | Non-standard nested-service-style manifests are detected and normalized to canonical ManifestConfig | ✓ VERIFIED | wild-manifest.ts lines 120-162 detects depth-1 and depth-2 nested structures; manifest.test.ts lines 333-358 test both patterns; all pass |
| 8 | Wild manifest normalization produces warnings describing each transformation | ✓ VERIFIED | wild-manifest.ts lines 109-114 (WILD_MANIFEST_ARRAY_FORMAT), lines 155-160 (WILD_MANIFEST_NESTED_FORMAT), lines 221-228 (WILD_MANIFEST_NAME_PROMOTED); manifest.test.ts verifies warnings present |
| 9 | Financial data (amounts, addresses, networks) is never modified during normalization | ✓ VERIFIED | wild-manifest.ts line 103 casts to V2Config without modification; manifest.test.ts lines 309-330 explicitly tests long amounts and checksummed addresses preserved exactly |
| 10 | Endpoint IDs are generated from URL paths when available, with collision handling | ✓ VERIFIED | wild-manifest.ts lines 26-63 implements generateStableEndpointId with URL pathname extraction and -2, -3 collision suffix; manifest.test.ts lines 262-299 test URL-based IDs, fallback, and collisions |
| 11 | Empty manifests are detected as 'manifest' format | ✓ VERIFIED | guards.ts lines 54-60 allows empty endpoints {}; manifest.test.ts line 48-50 tests empty endpoints returns true; detection.test.ts confirms detect({endpoints:{}}) = 'manifest' |
| 12 | detect() still returns 'v2' for single v2 configs after manifest guard addition | ✓ VERIFIED | detect.ts line 27 checks manifest FIRST, then v2 on line 28; manifest.test.ts line 198-200 confirms v2 config returns 'v2'; detection.test.ts has v2 regression tests |

**Score:** 12/12 truths verified

### Key Link Verification

| From | To | Via | Status | Details |
|------|----|----|--------|---------|
| packages/x402lint/src/types/manifest.ts | packages/x402lint/src/types/config.ts | imports V2Config for endpoints Record value type | ✓ WIRED | Line 5: `import type { V2Config } from './config'`; used in ManifestConfig interface line 35 |
| packages/x402lint/src/detection/detect.ts | packages/x402lint/src/detection/guards.ts | imports and calls isManifestConfig before isV2Config | ✓ WIRED | Line 8 imports isManifestConfig; line 27: `if (isManifestConfig(parsed)) return 'manifest'` appears before v2 check on line 28 |

| packages/x402lint/src/detection/wild-manifest.ts | packages/x402lint/src/types/manifest.ts | imports ManifestConfig for return type | ✓ WIRED | Line 6: `import type { ManifestConfig, V2Config, ValidationIssue } from '../types'`; used in WildManifestResult interface line 14 and normalizeWildManifest return type line 84 |
| packages/x402lint/src/detection/wild-manifest.ts | packages/x402lint/src/detection/guards.ts | imports isRecord, hasAcceptsArray for structural checks | ✓ WIRED | Line 7: `import { isRecord } from './guards'`; used 13 times throughout the file for structural validation |

### Requirements Coverage

| Requirement | Status | Blocking Issue |
|-------------|--------|----------------|
| MAN-01: Manifest schema definition (collection of v2 PaymentRequired entries with service metadata) | ✓ SATISFIED | None — ManifestConfig type defines endpoints: Record<string, V2Config> with optional ServiceMetadata |
| MAN-04: Compatibility layer for non-standard wild manifests (normalize biwas-style formats) | ✓ SATISFIED | None — normalizeWildManifest() handles array-style and nested-service-style with warnings; financial data preserved |

### Anti-Patterns Found

No anti-patterns detected. All files are substantive with real implementations:

- No TODO/FIXME comments found
- No placeholder content
- No empty return statements
- No console.log-only implementations
- All functions have complete logic
- Test coverage is comprehensive (42 manifest tests + 3 regression tests)

### Human Verification Required

None. All verification criteria are programmatically testable:

1. TypeScript compilation status (verified: passes)
2. Test suite results (verified: 339/339 pass)
3. Type guard behavior (verified: 14 test cases cover true/false scenarios)
4. Detection order (verified: manifest checked before v2 in code and tests)
5. Wild normalization patterns (verified: array-style and nested-service tests pass)
6. Financial data preservation (verified: explicit test with long amounts and checksummed addresses)
