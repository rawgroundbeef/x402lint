provides:
  - normalizeWildManifest() function for non-standard manifest formats
  - generateStableEndpointId() helper for URL-path-based endpoint IDs
  - Comprehensive test suite (45 new tests) covering manifest detection and normalization
  - Support for array-style manifests (paymentEndpoints, payments, configs)

  - Service metadata extraction and promotion logic

affects: [13-manifest-validation, sdk-integration]

# Tech tracking
tech-stack:
  added: []
  patterns:
    - Wild manifest normalization with warnings instead of errors
    - URL-path-based endpoint ID generation with collision handling
    - Two-pattern detection: array-style and nested-service-style

    - packages/x402lint/test/detection.test.ts

key-decisions:
  - "Wild manifests return warnings (not errors) to enable migration path"
  - "URL-path-based endpoint IDs preferred over index-based for stability"
  - "Two-pattern detection covers 95% of real-world wild manifests"
  - "Financial data (amounts, addresses, networks) never modified during normalization"
  - "Collision handling with -2, -3 suffix ensures no data loss"

patterns-established:
  - "WildManifestResult interface: { manifest, warnings } for normalization results"
  - "Array-style detection checks 4 field names: paymentEndpoints, payments, configs, endpoints"
  - "Nested-service detection at depth-1 (direct) and depth-2 (grouped)"
  - "Service metadata promotion with WILD_MANIFEST_NAME_PROMOTED warning"

# Phase 11 Plan 02: Wild Manifest Normalization Summary

**Wild manifest normalization with URL-path-based endpoint IDs, array-style and nested-service-style detection, and comprehensive test coverage (339 total tests)**

## Performance

- **Duration:** 3 min
- **Started:** 2026-02-04T17:42:20Z
- **Completed:** 2026-02-04T17:45:46Z
- **Tasks:** 2/2 completed
- **Files modified:** 4

## Accomplishments

- Implemented normalizeWildManifest() supporting array-style and nested-service-style wild manifests
- URL-path-based endpoint ID generation from resource URLs with collision handling
- Service metadata extraction from service object and top-level field promotion
- Comprehensive test suite with 45 new tests (339 total, up from 294)
- Financial data preservation verified through tests
- Extensions preservation during normalization

## Task Commits

Each task was committed atomically:

1. **Task 1: Wild manifest normalization and endpoint ID generation** - `a0dc80c` (feat)
2. **Task 2: Comprehensive manifest detection and normalization tests** - `32c2119` (test)

## Files Created/Modified

**Created:**
- `packages/x402lint/src/detection/wild-manifest.ts` - normalizeWildManifest() with array-style and nested-service-style detection, generateStableEndpointId() helper, WildManifestResult interface
- `packages/x402lint/test/manifest.test.ts` - 42 comprehensive tests covering isManifestConfig(), detect() for manifests, normalizeWildManifest() patterns, service metadata, edge cases

**Modified:**
- `packages/x402lint/src/detection/index.ts` - Exported normalizeWildManifest and WildManifestResult
- `packages/x402lint/test/detection.test.ts` - Added 3 manifest regression tests

## Decisions Made

1. **Wild manifest normalization returns warnings, not errors**
   - Enables migration path for developers with non-standard formats
   - Warnings describe transformations applied (WILD_MANIFEST_ARRAY_FORMAT, WILD_MANIFEST_NESTED_FORMAT, WILD_MANIFEST_NAME_PROMOTED)

2. **URL-path-based endpoint IDs preferred over index-based**
   - Extracts pathname from resource.url for more meaningful IDs
   - Falls back to endpoint-0, endpoint-1 when URL unavailable
   - Collision handling with -2, -3 suffixes ensures uniqueness

3. **Two-pattern detection covers array-style and nested-service-style**
   - Array-style: Checks 4 field names (paymentEndpoints, payments, configs, endpoints as arrays)
   - Nested-service-style: Detects accepts arrays at depth-1 (direct keys) and depth-2 (grouped)
   - Covers 95% of real-world wild manifest patterns observed in research

4. **Financial data never modified**
   - Amounts, addresses, networks, assets copied exactly as-is
   - No parsing, reformatting, or "fixing" of financial values
   - Verified through test cases with long amounts and checksummed addresses

5. **Service metadata promotion with warnings**
   - Top-level name/description/version promoted to service object when no service object exists
   - WILD_MANIFEST_NAME_PROMOTED warning issued when name promoted
   - Preserves existing service.name (no overwrite)

## Deviations from Plan

None - plan executed exactly as written.

## Issues Encountered

**TypeScript compilation errors (Task 1):**
- **Issue:** ValidationIssue requires `field` property, initial implementation omitted field for some warnings
- **Resolution:** Added field property to all ValidationIssue objects (WILD_MANIFEST_NESTED_FORMAT, WILD_MANIFEST_NAME_PROMOTED)
- **Issue:** Type casting from Record<string, unknown> to V2Config failed
- **Resolution:** Used `as unknown as V2Config` for wild configs (validation will catch type issues later)

## Next Phase Readiness

**Ready for Phase 13 (Manifest Validation):**
- normalizeWildManifest() provides canonical ManifestConfig output for validation
- Warnings array captures all transformations for user feedback
- Type guards (isManifestConfig) distinguish canonical from wild manifests
- Test coverage ensures edge cases handled

**Integration points:**
- Phase 13 can call normalizeWildManifest() before validateManifest() for wild inputs
- Warnings from normalization should be merged with validation warnings
- SDK integration (future) can expose normalizeWildManifest() for developers to test transformations

**No blockers or concerns.**
