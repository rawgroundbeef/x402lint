# Milestone v1.0: MVP

**Status:** SHIPPED 2026-01-29
**Phases:** 1-4
**Total Plans:** 5 (3 executed via GSD, 2 planned but superseded by manual work)

## Overview

Transform x402 payment configuration validation from manual specification checking to instant feedback. Build client-side validation engine with proxy support, enabling developers to validate configs in under 30 seconds. Progress from core validation logic through input handling to polished display, delivering a simple developer tool with zero framework complexity.

## Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation & Validation
**Goal**: Validation engine correctly validates x402 configs with chain-specific address checking
**Depends on**: Nothing (first phase)
**Plans**: 2 plans

Plans:
- [x] 01-01: Project setup with HTML scaffold and chain configuration
- [x] 01-02: Core validation engine with all VAL requirements

### Phase 2: Input & Proxy
**Goal**: Users can submit configs via URL or direct JSON paste with smart auto-detection
**Depends on**: Phase 1
**Plans**: 2 plans

Plans:
- [x] 02-01: Cloudflare Worker CORS proxy setup and deployment
- [ ] 02-02: Smart input UI with URL fetching and config extraction (superseded by manual implementation)

### Phase 3: Results Display
**Goal**: Users see clear pass/fail status with actionable error messages
**Depends on**: Phase 2
**Plans**: TBD (implemented manually ahead of roadmap)

### Phase 4: Polish
**Goal**: Tool is production-ready with mobile support and comprehensive edge case coverage
**Depends on**: Phase 3
**Plans**: TBD (implemented manually ahead of roadmap)

## Milestone Summary

**Key Decisions:**
- Plain HTML/JS over React (simplicity, zero build step, fast to ship)
- Cloudflare Worker for proxy (lightweight, free tier sufficient, easy deploy)
- Strict chain validation (permissive mode adds complexity, known chains cover real use cases)
- Skip facilitator reachability (overkill for v1, just validate structure)
- CDN with SRI hashes for library integrity verification
- ethers.js v5.7.2 over v6 for better CDN availability
- Layered validation: JSON parse -> version -> payments -> fields -> addresses -> semantics

**Issues Resolved:**
- wrangler.toml location corrected for Cloudflare Worker deployment
- Chain-specific checksum implementation (ethers.js + bs58 approach chosen)

**Issues Deferred:**
- x402 spec documentation for complete validation rules (validator built on assumptions, not canonical spec)

**Technical Debt Incurred:**
- Validator field names don't match canonical x402 v2 spec (uses `payments`/`address`/`chain`/`minAmount` instead of `accepts`/`payTo`/`network`/`amount`)
- No unit tests for validation logic
- No automated test suite
- Phases 2-4 partially implemented outside GSD workflow (no SUMMARY.md for all work)
